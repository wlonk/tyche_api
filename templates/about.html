<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Tyche is the Greek goddess who oversees a city's fortune. Or, in this case,
  the Discord bot who rolls dice, manages roles, and plays music.

  Years ago, when <a href="https://transneptune.net/">we</a> had an XMPP
  server, we made a bot for it named Tyche, and this is its successor.
